supfig10dat.Rdata contains the average fraction of catch from oceanodromous species and average ocean surface current direction within 50 km of each EEZ-sea region's high seas boundary between 2012 and 2016

Variables:
-MarRegion: EEZ-sea region
-outflow: Average surface current direction. A value of 0 means the current is always flowing into the EEZ-sea region
-notnon: Proportion of catch from species that are not non-migratory
-oceano: Proportion of catch from species that are oceanodromous
